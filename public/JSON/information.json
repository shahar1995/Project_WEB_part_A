    "description" : "Functional training is a type of exercise that focuses on improving movements that are fundamental to daily activities, sports, and fitness. The goal of functional training is to enhance one's overall strength, endurance, balance, and flexibility in ways that can improve the body's ability to function efficiently and prevent injuries.Functional training typically involves exercises that mimic real-life movements, such as squatting, lunging, twisting, pushing, and pulling. These exercises can be performed with free weights, resistance bands, kettlebells, or bodyweight exercises, and can target multiple muscle groups simultaneously.One of the key principles of functional training is that it is adaptable to the individual's fitness level and goals.

    "Name": "Strength Training",
    "description" : "Strength training is a type of exercise that focuses on building muscular strength, endurance, and size. It typically involves using resistance, such as weights or resistance bands, to challenge the muscles and promote growth.Strength training can be done with a variety of equipment, including free weights, weight machines, and bodyweight exercises. Examples of strength training exercises include squats, deadlifts, bench press, push-ups, pull-ups, and lunges.One of the key principles of strength training is progressive overload, which means gradually increasing the resistance or weight over time to continue challenging the muscles and promoting growth. This can be achieved by adding more weight to a barbell or dumbbell, performing more repetitions or sets, or increasing the difficulty of bodyweight exercises.Strength training has numerous benefits, including increased muscle mass and strength, improved bone density, and a higher metabolism. It can also help improve balance and reduce the risk of falls in older adults, and it may have a positive impact on mental health by reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety.Strength training can be beneficial for people of all ages and fitness levels, but it is particularly important for athletes, older adults, and people with chronic conditions such as osteoporosis, arthritis, or obesity. It is typically recommended to engage in strength training at least two to three times per week, with a focus on working all major muscle groups in the body. ",
